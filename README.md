## 🚀 Project Overview

**ACIRP** is a next-generation civic grievance platform designed as an **AI Operating System** rather than a static administrative dashboard. ACIRP replaces slow human triage queues and brittle databases with an autonomous agent loop that classifies hazards, plans jurisdictions, files petitions, monitors progress, compiles physical fallback alerts, and compares before/after photos using vision models to verify resolution.

### Key Architectural Innovation: "Resilient Failover Triage"
If public portals go offline or SLA timelines are breached, the agent autonomously halts backend requests and fails over to emergency routing protocols—compiling formal PDFs for physical dispatch and routing coordinates straight to ward supervisors.

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **🧠 Perception Agent (Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision):** Automatically extracts incident category, hazard details, and coordinates from uploaded citizen imagery.
2. **🎯 Intelligent Planner Core:** Evaluates jurisdictional routing strategies, calculates exact SLA deadlines, and monitors ticket status in portal registries.
3. **💥 Simulator Console & Time-Travel:** Interactive dashboard controls to simulate **Gateway Portal Crashes (HTTP 504)** and **24h Time Jumps (SLA Breaches)**.
4. **📄 Automatic Document Dispatcher:** Generates signed, formatted grievance dispatch PDFs directed to Chief Engineers on SLA breach.
5. **📸 Visual Verification Loop:** Compares Before and After cleanup photos side-by-side using vision comparison logic to confirm resolutions and archive tickets.
6. **🎨 Futuristic Glassmorphism UI:** Centered around a glowing, color-shifting **AI Orb** representing active reasoning states.
